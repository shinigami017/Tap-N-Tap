# Tap-N-Tap

This is a web-app made for fun. Main aim behind making this project was to practice on javascript libraries like Paper.js and Howler.js


[Paper.js](https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js) is an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of the HTML5 Canvas. It offers a clean Scene Graph / Document Object Model and a lot of powerful functionality to create and work with vector graphics and bezier curves, all neatly wrapped up in a well designed, consistent and clean programming interface.

[Howler.js](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) is an audio library for the modern web. It defaults to Web Audio API and falls back to HTML5 Audio. This makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms.
